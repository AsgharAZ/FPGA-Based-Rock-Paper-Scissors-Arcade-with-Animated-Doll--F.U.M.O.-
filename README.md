# FPGA-Based Rock-Paper-Scissors Arcade with Animated Doll (F.U.M.O.)
 This project presents an FPGA-based arcade game where players compete in rock-paper-scissors against a computer. Implemented on a Basys-3 board, the game displays outcomes on a VGA monitor and features an animated doll (F.U.M.O.) that reacts to the results. Players use push buttons to make their selection, while the FPGA generates a random choice for the computer and determines the winner. The VGA monitor shows the game status, and the doll mirrors the results with celebratory or sulking animations using servo motors. This project blends digital design, sequential logic, and hardware interfacing to create an engaging interactive experience.
